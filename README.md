# Litefy

A lightweight Spotify client for low-end smartphones (KaiOS included [not yet]) and computers.
The project is being designed with Angular 10, using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/) and [Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/).

## Development server

Run `npm install` && `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### If you run into problems like "ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED" error when using the ng serve or the ng build command, try using an older version of node (< 17) as this could be due an application or a module weâ€™re using is attempting to use an algorithm or key size which is no longer allowed by default with OpenSSL 3.0, after the new update.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
